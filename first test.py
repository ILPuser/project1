# NONLOCAL and GLOBAL

#Example 6: Create a nonlocal variable
#nonlocal allows us to assign values to an outer (but non-global) scope.
#for assigning values to the global scope, we can use global keyword instead.
def outer():
    x = "local"

    def inner():
        #nonlocal x
        
        x = "nonlocal"
        print("inner:", x)

    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

# YIELD in Python

# Yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and # when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement. Any function that contains a yield keyword # is termed a generator. Hence, yield is what makes a generator.27-May-2021


# Decorators in Python

#-------- orig_func already given ----------
def orig_func():
   print("Wheee!")

#------ write decorator ------------
def my_decorator(some_function):
    def my_wrapper():
        print ("do something before")   #do something before, if you want to
        some_function()
        print ("do something after")    #do something after, if you want to
    return my_wrapper

#------ create decorator and call orig func --------
orig_func = my_decorator(orig_func)   #create decorator, modify functioning 
orig_func()  


# Closures in Python
 #the inner_func has the full access to the environment (variables) in itâ€™s enclosing scope. That is closure.
 
 
  #####Dictionary in Python
 #A Python dictionary is a collection of items in no particular order. Python dictionaries are written in curly brackets with #keys and values. Dictionaries are optimised to retrieve value for known keys.

 ####List comprehensions are used for transforming one list into another list. Elements can be conditionally included in the new list and each element can be transformed as needed. It consists of an expression leading a for clause, enclosed in brackets. for ex: list = [i for i in range(1000)]
#list comprehension are used for transforming one list into another list.


###The map() function in Python is used for applying a function on all elements of a specified iterable.

##Note that Number values, strings, and tuple are immutable while as List or Dictionary object are mutable.

##Strip() function is used to remove the leading and trailing white spaces while the replace() function is used to remove all the white spaces in the string:
